# JAVA-Project_Online-Order-System
Developing an Online Order System for Academic Study

This project was developed as part of the coursework for the CSE215 course at North South University. It was built using the Java programming language and GUI components. The main objective of the project was to create a functional online order system.

The project was designed with a focus on simplicity and practicality. Despite being a basic project, it aimed to simulate the process of ordering items online in a realistic manner.

Throughout the development process, I encountered various challenges, including designing an intuitive user interface and ensuring the system was reliable and efficient.

Overall, the project represents a valuable learning experience for me, as it provided hands-on experience with Java programming and GUI development.
